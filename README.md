## Welcome to my ✨ _profile_ ✨ 
👩🏻‍💻 Currently working as an Intermediate iOS Software Engineer, I focus on delivering modular and maintainable Swift codebases using:
  * Swift, SwiftUI, Combine
  * GraphQL (Apollo), Firebase, Realm
  * Agile methodologies, CI/CD integration, and collaborative workflows

### 📍What you'll find here 
* Modular iOS architectures
* Real-world unit testing patterns
* Experiments with design patterns and modern tech stacks

### 🎆Highlights from My Work
* **Integration Workflow Optimization**:  </br>
Reduced story point estimates from 8/5 to 3 and below by streamlining Apollo Studio query setup and GraphQL gateway integration—boosting team velocity and delivery confidence.
* **GraphQL Resolver Development**: </br>
Built custom resolvers in sandbox environments and refactored legacy logic to improve performance and readability across shared modules.
* **Swift Memory Management Insight**:  </br>
Diagnosed and fixed a silent unit test failure caused by ARC mismanagement. Implemented withExtendedLifetime for proper object retention—improving test reliability and deepening my grasp of Swift's memory model.

### 👩🏻‍💻Projects I've worked on
- Vitality UK 
- Gyde 

While iOS is my current domain, I’m actively expanding my technical toolkit to include broader software engineering concepts and new tech stacks. This includes:

* Diving deeper into systems design, software architecture, and design patterns
* Exploring other languages 
* Understanding backend fundamentals (e.g., APIs, databases, CI/CD)
